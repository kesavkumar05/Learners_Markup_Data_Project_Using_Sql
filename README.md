# Learners_Markup_Data_Project_Using_Sql

## Part 0: Download the src files
1. First, Download the src file in your local system.
2. Now, open MySql Wrokbench in your system and create Database (or) Schema and import the src file to that particular database.
## Part 1: Selecting the Table  
1. First, use SELECT * from both tables and use your knowledge of queries:

## Part 2: Implement aggregate functions to get to know the data:

1. What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
2. How many .edu learners are located in New York?
3. The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

## Part 3: Use Time format Function to format Time

1. The data type of the sign_up_at column is DATETIME. It is for storing a date/time value in the database.<br>
SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.<br>
It takes two arguments: strftime(format, column)<br>
Now, using this function, query for the sign up counts for each hour.<br>


## Part 4: Join the two tables using JOIN and then see what you can dig out of the data!

1. Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
2. What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?
3. What courses are the Chicago students taking?
